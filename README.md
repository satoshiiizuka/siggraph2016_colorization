## Overview

This code provides an implementation of the research paper:

```
  "Let there be Color!: Joint End-to-end Learning of Global and Local Image Priors for Automatic Image Colorization with Simultaneous Classification"
  Satoshi Iizuka, Edgar Simo-Serra, and Hiroshi Ishikawa
  ACM Transaction on Graphics (Proc. of SIGGRAPH 2016), 2016
```

We learn to automatically color grayscale images with a deep network. Our
network learns both local features and global features jointly in a single
framework. Our approach can then be used on images of any resolution. By
incorporating global features we are able to obtain realistic colorings with
our model.

See our [project page](http://hi.cs.waseda.ac.jp/~iizuka/projects/colorization/) for more detailed information.

## Dependencies

- [Torch7](http://torch.ch/docs/getting-started.html)
- [nn](https://github.com/torch/nn)
- [image](https://github.com/torch/image)
- [nngraph](https://github.com/torch/nngraph)

All packages should be part of a standard Torch7 install. For information on how to install Torch7 please see the [official torch documentation](http://torch.ch/docs/getting-started.html) on the subject.

## Usage

First, download the colorization model by running the download script:

```
./download_model.sh
```

Basic usage is:

```
th colorize.lua <input_image> [<output_image>]
```

For example:

```
th colorize.lua ansel_colorado_1941.png out.png
```

### Best Performance

- This model was trained on the [Places dataset](http://places.csail.mit.edu/) and thus best performance is for natural outdoor images.
- While the model works on any size image, we trained it on 224x224 pixel images and thus it works best on small images. Note that you can process a small image to obtain the chrominance map and then rescale it and combine it with the original grayscale image for higher quality.
- Larger image sizes can give uneven colorings (limited by spatial support of the network).

### Notes

- This is developed on a linux machine running Ubuntu 14.04 during late 2015.
- The provided code does not use GPU accelerated (trivial to change).
- Please note that the model is slow on large images (over 512x512 pixels) and may run out of memory. Demo should take around 2 GiB of peak RAM memory, system with 4 GiB or more of RAM is recommended.
- Provided model and sample code is under a non-commercial creative commons license.
